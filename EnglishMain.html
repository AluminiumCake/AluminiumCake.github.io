<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
<center><p>I was born in Belarus. I have been living in Poland for several years.</p></center>
<center><p>I speak several languages ​​- Belarusian, Russian, English, Polish, and Spanish. I also understand most Slavic languages.</p></center>
<center><p>I started writing music in January 2024 and released my first release - Farsh.</p></center>
<center><p>My first VOCALOID song was I'm Always Here To Support You feat. MEIKO.</p></center>
<center><p>My favourite vocal-synth is OpenUTAU. My favorite voicebanks are MEIKO, Uta Utane, and Xingchen Stardust.</p></center>
<center><p>I first registered on YouTube on May 20, 2018, my birthday. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A0%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD">This is the channel.</a></p></center>
<center><p>I love playing video games. My favourites are Mount&Blade, Geometry Dash, Half-Life and Spore.</p></center>
<center><p>In elementary and middle school, I went to music school. I played percussion instruments - the xylophone and drums.</p></center>
<center><p>My favorite musical instruments are the violin, piano, and drums.</p></center>
<center><p>I listen to everything I like; genre doesn't make sense. My favorite VOCALOID producer is EZFG, my favorite VOCALOID song is Kimi to boku no resonance.</p></center>
<center><p>I like to do everything alone. I dislike having to do something in a group of more than three people.</p></center>
<center><p>I don't know what else to write here...</p></center>
