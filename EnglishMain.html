  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I was born in Belarus. I have been living in Poland for several years.</p>
  <p>I speak several languages â€” Belarusian, Russian, English, Polish, and Spanish.</p>
  <p>I started writing music in January 2024 and released my first release - Farsh.</p>
  <p>My first VOCALOID song was I'm Always Here To Support You feat. MEIKO.</p>
  <p>My favourite vocal-synth is OpenUTAU. My favorite voicebanks are MEIKO, Uta Utane, and Xingchen Stardust.</p>
  <p>I first registered on YouTube on May 20, 2018, my birthday. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A0%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD">This is the channel.</a></p>
  <p>I love playing video games. My favourites are Mount&Blade, Geometry Dash, Half-Life and Spore.</p>
  <p>In elementary and middle school, I went to music school. I played percussion instruments - the xylophone and drums.</p>
  <p>My favorite musical instruments are the violin, piano, and drums.</p>
  <p>I listen to everything I like; genre doesn't matter. My favorite VOCALOID producer is EZFG, my favorite VOCALOID song is Kimi to boku no resonance.</p>
  <p>I like to do everything alone. I dislike doing things in groups larger than three.</p>
  <p>I don't know what else to write here...</p>
